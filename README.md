# Backpropagation-for-ANN

Backprogration is among the most common training algorithms for feed-forward neural networks. At the foundation of it, the algorithm fine-tunes the weights of the network such that the error of the network is minimized - it does so by performing gradient descent on the loss function. The code in this repository implements a simple 3 layer neural network that is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.
